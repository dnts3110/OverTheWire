OverTheWire Wargames write-ups

My plan is to finish the Bandit phase in a week or two and move on to next phase, and then keep update this so that I can always comeback if I forget something.

I will document my thoughts each phase so that hopefully anyone who might be struggling can find this helpful.
Also I will try to find another way if possible to tackle each challenges since it will be fun :).
